				<p style="font-size:22px"> Reading is one of my passions, especially when there is a rainy day. I enjoy curling up under a blanket with a cup of joe and a good book. I partake in ingesting knowledge in genres from fiction and non-fiction to novels and history.</p>

				<h2>Favorite Authors </h2>
					<dl>
						<dt ><i>Yuval Noah Harari</i></dt>
						<dd >- Sapiens</dd>
						<dd>- 21 Rules for the 21st Century</dd>
                        <dd>- In my opinion, Yuval Dominates the Social philosiphy genre through his creative takes on issues through books such as Sapiens.</dd>
                        

						<dt><i>Rick Riordan</i></dt>
						<dd>- The Heroes of Olympus series</dd> 
                        
						<dd>- The Kane Chronicles</dd>
						<dd>- Rick Riordan's works are what first developed my love for reading. Through delving into Greek, Norse, and ancient Eygptian Mythologies, Rick Riordan creates deep and creative stories with well-developed character and plotlines.</dd>

						<dt><i>Fydor Doestevesky</i></dt>
						<dd>-  Crime and Punishment</dd>
						<dd>-  The Brothers Karmazov</dd>
                        <dd>-  One of the greatest authors of all time, Dosoevesky's works need no introduction, with his books usually depicting two stories, the one represented by the words on the page and the one that can be found between the lines.</dd>
